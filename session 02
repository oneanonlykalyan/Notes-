=========

Region --> HYD, Mumbai, Singapore, US, EU
AZ --> North HYD, South HYD --> min 2 AZ --> High availability

Instance == Server == node

allow everyone one through firewall

inbound --> incoming traffic

.iso --> It will create entire operating system --> C:\Windows

Redhat Enterprise Linux == Centos == Amazon Enterprise Linux == Fedora == AlmaLinux

Kernel == Brain of OS == C language
User Interface

Linus torvalds == Inventor of Linux
Mac -> Hardware locking --> you are buying both hardware and Mac OS

Servers == Unix
Laptops == IBM BIOS

Linux -> C language == Kernel
OS == Kernel + User Interface == Open Source

Linux Implementations == Distributions == Flavours
=======================
RHEL --> Commercial
IBM AIX
Ubuntu
Fedora
Solaris
Suse
Android

OpenSource and Enterprise

AWS Linux 2023 AMI
t3.micro/t2.micro

Authentication

Delhi --> HYD

f:no, apartment name, pincode

siva, 523764

ssh -i <private-key> ec2-user@IP

1. Create public and private keys
2. Import public key
3. Create firewall
4. Create Instance
5. Connect to Instance
6. Terminate when not using
